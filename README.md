# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
#Overview of the analysis:

Pewlett Hackard company wants to know the number of retirement ready employees out of around 300,000 employees. They also want to know the number of the current employees who are ready for mentorship program to cope up the situation they named as ‘Silver Tsunami’.

 ##Explain the purpose of this analysis.
 
Our job is to create an employee database with SQL by Data Modelling, engineering and analysis skill to show the number of retiring and mentorship read employees.
Using SQL we’ll be connecting employee database with title to get the name, date of birth, and title and prepare a list  to retrieve the employees who were born between 1952 and 1955.

Results: 

•	There are 90,398 number of employees are ready to retire.

•	The employees ready for mentorship program is very less compared to the required employees.

•	If we increase the Date of birth from 1965 to Dec 1970, we’ll get around 20,000 employees to mentor which is almost 22% of the retirement employees.

Summary:

The number of retiring employees and the current employees who are ready for mentorship is very less. The administration has to be ready to get more employees for mentorship by increasing the date of birth range or be prepared to recruit a lot to adjust with upcoming ‘Silver Tsunami’.
